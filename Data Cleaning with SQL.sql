-- continue to populate the other 3 companys to check

-- after running this query, noticed that there is 0 row updated, which mean still the same, need to find out why 
-- it might probably due to t1.industry are all blank value, so let us set t1.industry which is blank to NULL 

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
